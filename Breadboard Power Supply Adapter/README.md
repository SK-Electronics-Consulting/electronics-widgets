# Breadboard Power Supply Adapter

## Background
I've run into some recurring issues when using bench power supplies with projects under development.  
1. The cables tend to be heavy relative to the project PCB.  
2. I commonly use power supplies that are 4-wire, such as the Keithley 2302.
3. The connections will regularly be pushed into a breadboard, and usually in a sloppy manner.

## Solution
A simple board that breaks out the connections into convenient points.  It will get "anchored" by a breadboard, and provide easy connections.
