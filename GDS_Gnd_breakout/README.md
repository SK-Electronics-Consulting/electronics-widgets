# Gridfinity Breadboard GND breakout

This is a small breakout board to solve a simple problem: relatively heavy items like o-scope probe ground leads (and similar) pulling out pins from the breadboard itself.

It attaches to the [V10 Breadboard Holder](https://www.printables.com/model/449464-gridfinity-development-system-breadboard-holder) with 2 M3 screws.
