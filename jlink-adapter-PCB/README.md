# JLink-adapter PCB

## Background

This is a simple adapter PCB to go between the 20-pin JLink connector and the 10pin SWD connector.  However, it also adds some simple extra features link a Power LED, and a DUT-Power LED.  

## Todos

1. Fix the SWD connector footprint. It's currently 2 separate footprints overlapping, which causes all sorts of DRC grief.  
1. Consider adding some activity LEDs.
1. Fix the KiBot + Github integration.
